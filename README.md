# free-time-finder
A website that allows multiple people to easily find when they have common free time.

You can upload your work/school scheudle, block out certain times of certain days, and choose prefered times and days to be free.
Then you can search up your friends availabilty to have the computer compare your availabilities then suggest possible meeting times.
It does not have to be with just one person, you can add a group where the computer takes into account all the people's availability.
=======
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
